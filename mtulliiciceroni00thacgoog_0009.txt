Phaeaca

Tau teatof this editionis that of Zumpt, as it is found in his sinali-
er edition,* van'ed in every few instances on the authority of Beier,
Orelli, and Bonnell, and of Zumpt himself. The deviatione from
Zumpt’s text are generally, if not iu every case, accounted ior in the
notes.

The notes are derived chiefly from the editions of Zumpt und Bon·
neli,† which contem, besides their own, the valuahle remarks and expia·
uadens of the Heusingers and of Degen. Beier and Gemhard have
also been frequently consulted, aud especially the notes and treatises
of Garve, who discusses so thoroughly, and iu so lucid a manner, the
ideas contained iu this work of Cicero. There is au occasioual refer·
enee also to the edition of Stuerenhurg, to the German interpretation
and notes of Dr. A. W. Zumpt, and to the review of Bonnell in the
Neue Jahrbucher, numbers a and 3, of the lilith volume. 'l'he render
hes been referredsto Freund’s Latin lexicon, without any citation ol
the informatiou required, because it is understood that an American
edition of that excellent work, prepared under thesuperiutendence of a
mature and reliahle scholar, is soon to be presented to the public.

The present edition does not profess to contain all the notes of the
commentatore named above, who have labored on this work, nor indeed
the great body of them. As a general thing, all biographicai and his·
terical notes have been omitted. It was thought that learners in this
country were so well supplied with books of reference, containing at
considerable length the information necessary for the elucidation of
the text, that it was better to allow them to consult their manuals
themselves, than te fumish them with explanatione necessarily more
