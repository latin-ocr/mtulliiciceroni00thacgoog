scanty. The example of the German editors already named, and ur· -
deed of almost all German commentatore, can, it ie true, be quoted fo·
adifferent course. But it should be horne in mind that they prepare
their works for those who are not supplied with these books of refer·
ence. A German commentaryis a manscript of the instructions of the
class-roem, where oral teaching takes the place of silent study, and, to
agreat extent, supplies the want of manuale. Such a commentary
therefore contains all the explanatione which its author has been ac·
customed to give to hie class3 not only grammatica] and critical com·
mente, but those also which pertain to geography, history, biography,
and antiquities. It-should be observed, however, that German pupils
⁴ do not, ae a general rule, make use of such commentariee, but of the
amdomed text of the authors they study. In this edition, a few notes
of the historica] class spoken of have been introduced, in cases where
the dictionaries in common use have not been found to contain the de-
sired information.

The general design of the brief commentary is twofold: first, to
aid the learner in understanding the contente of the treatise, the
thoughts and connectione of thought of the author; aud second, to
explain grammatica] difficulties, and especially to inculcatea know·
ledge of grammatica] principles. The editor has aimed throughout to
guido rather than carrythe leamer through difficulties, requiring of
him more study in consequence of his help, than he would probably
have devoted to the book without it There will be found frequent
references to the grammare where there is no difficulty in translating
and understanding the author, and that for the mere purpose of in-
. ‘forming or reminding the learner of some law of the langnage. To
some these references will undoubtedly seem too numerous. They
will seem to leave to the careful student too little opportunity to ex·
ercise hie own ingenuity, to leave him no difficulties to solve himself.
There is much force in this objectiou, and in the preparation of some
works for the use of learners it ought to prevail. But yet, considering
’ the attainments of the great body of studente who'would be likely to
read this book3 would not more on the whole be gained by a multipli-
oation of references than by their omission? Besides, numerous as
they are, they do not comprise all that are inserted by Zumpt himself
iu his edition, not a few having been omitted, as uunecessarily directing
the attention of the learner to principles, with which, it might be taken
for granted, that he was already sufficiently familiar. On this point,
therefore, the error, if there is one, is probably ou the sideof soantinese.

The notes are not all referred to their sources. Of those which are
