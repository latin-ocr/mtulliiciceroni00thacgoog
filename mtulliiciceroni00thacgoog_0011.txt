rot thus referred, there ure two classes llrst, those which ure oom-
non to several different editions end are nncredited in all, and may
therefore be considered common property3 second, those which bave
been added bythe American editor. Most of the derived notes, besides
being translated, have been very mnch clnngedin their form, by being
³ abridgcd, condensed, and otherwise modified3 und in some cases eo
much eo, thet it seemed hardly fuir to impute the note in its new nhape
to its real author. Some comments, therefore, will appear to be claim-
ed for this edition es original, which, by suggestion nt least, ere due to
another. But it will be very easy for any one, who hes the authors
ennmernted in the beginning of this prefeee, to see for himself to what
extent the notes are derived from others. A slight compurison will
show thet the present editor has bsd little to do, but to nse his judg·

3 No pert of the writings of Cicero hus been more fortunate than the
. De Officiis in respect to the preservation and perfecting of its text, nor
will it suffer in comperison with any in regurd to the ebility with which
its text bas been illustrated and explained. If the book, now, not with·
out diffidence, presented to the public, shnll have contributed any thing
ᾗ to malie the valuable lubors of others ruore extensively uvailoble, its
object will have been accomplished. It hus been prepared in the midst
L of other duties, and reterded in its preparation by the repeated und pro-
ἶ treeted illness of its editor, und might put in u plea for the indulgence
which it will doubtlees need.

ln'tlre first chapter of the second book, Cicero expresses the appre-
hension, thet some good men moy find funlt with his devotion to philos·
ophy. He vindicates himself, however, by eaying thet he can no
Ι longer benefit the commonweulth by his cere und counsels, inusmucb
us it is now under the tyrannicol control of one man. He must,
therefore, give his activity a new direction. To yield to patriotie grief,
invievv of the sad change ln the state, would soon exhaust und pros·
trate him. Το give himself up to pleusures, at such an emergency‚
would be unworthy of emen of his cultivation. He turns, therefore,

from professioual end politieul duties. Nor dees he turn to philosophy
