viii sarraca. ·

But wlule Cicero thus defends his occupatiori to the public, ht hasa
private and perhaps a more weighty reason for the composition of this
philosophical meatim-a reason which should nothe lost sight of in
reading it, for it gives 3 key to the character of the work. The mo·
tive referred to is his desire to instruct his son. ,

He had sent him to Athens to pursue the study of philosophy under
=Cratippus ; bnt moved by some unfavorable reports respecting his con·

duct there, he had determined to visit him. A storm interrupted his
voyage soon after he had weighcd anchor, and drove him back to the
shore of Italy, and news from Rome prevented his setting sail again
He wrote this treatise, therefore, as asubstitute for the oral counsel
which he had intended to give. This fact-the fact that the work is
addressed by Cicero to his son—'gives direction to the course of thought

’ contained in it Itis not a code of morals for mankind in general, but

it is particularly adapted to the circumstances of theson of a distin·
guished Roman statesman, who might be expected to seek distinction
in public life as his father haddone. The book, therefore, does not
address itself to the middle and lower classes, except as the general
principles embodied and discussed in it are applicable to their condi·
tion. The examples and illustratione are 311 drawn from the highest
offices in the state, and from the highest walks of life. Thus thevalue
of the ¹treatise asa philosophical work is perhaps diminished hythe
contraction of its scope, while the interest in it is increased by the fre·
quent display of parontal regard.

This single remark respecting the design of the work is 311 that is
necessary here by way of introduction. What has been deemed requi·

. site for aid to the leainer in understanding its basis and plan, as well

as its terms, will be found ir the notes*
