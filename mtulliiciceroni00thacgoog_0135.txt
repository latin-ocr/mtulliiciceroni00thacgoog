Annam jam audientem] Cicero sent his son to Athens about the first
of April, B. (145, as we leam from a letter written by him to Atticus the
next year, (Ep. ad Atticum XV. la) in which, speaking of his son, he says:
scripsit, sibi, post Kal. April-sic enim annum tenpus confici-nihil da·
tum esse. As he says in the text that bis son has been hearing Cratippus
a year, itis inferred that Cicero began this treatisc in the spring, or early
ln the summer 44 Β. 0, two or three months at most after the assassina·
tion of (laesar.

On the other hand, the following reasons may be given for believing that
the treatise was not commenced till the autumnos the same year: 1. In
the very frequent letters of this period, which give us almost the daily oc-
cupations 01 Cicero, there is no mention of a work de Officiis till Oct 24,
(Ep. ad Att XV. 13.) 2. Oioero implica (de on HL 33) that this book
was intended as a substitute for the instruction which he had designed
giving his son in person at Athens It may be supposed, therefore, that it
was written after the projeet of visiting Greece was abandoned He in·
forms ns (Ep, ad Att XVL 1) that having set out on the voyage, he was
driven back to the vicinity of Rhegium on the sixth of August, and was
indueed to give up his visit to bis son, and retinn 10 Rome, hythe repre
sentations 01 his friends that a favorable change in public affairs had taken
place, and that his presence was demanded He reached the capital the
last day ol' August, and having, on the second of September, delivered his
first Philippic, retired soon after to his country-seat Puteolanum. Here he

spent the months of October and November, and is supposedto have em·

ployed himself in writing this work Itis agreed that it was finished be
lore the ninth of December.

A. W. Zumpt suggests that the disagreement here set forth may be

' reconciled by supposing that the young Cicero, although he left home the

. first of April, did not for some time actually commence his atterulancc
