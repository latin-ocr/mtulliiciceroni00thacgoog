Aristo of Chios, and Herillus of Oartlrage were Stoies3 Pyrrho was ee
founder of the sect of the Skeptics. They agreed in oonsidering all exte '
nal things indifferent-in denying that they should be reckoned among
things good or evil. 1. Pyrrho taught this by denying all grounds oi trnth
For, il in the case os our objects ol thought there is never any reason tor
considering them, or any one of them, true rather than false, then oi course
there is never any true ground for asserting that any external objectis
good, or a proper object of desire or preference “Pyrrho is said to be tle
originator of the doctrine that there is no difference between health and
siclmoss, lile and death’'

2. Aristo, like Herillus, deriated from Zeno, their common teacher and
the founder of their sect. He rejected all parts of philosophy except ethice,
anderen limited the domain ol ethice itself, for he taught that ite object
is not to trent of particular duties and encouragements to virtue, but that
it is the province os the philosopher to show wherein the supreme good
consiste. “With Aristo, neughtis of worth but virtue, nothing is evil but
vice. He seeks to refute the opinion that there is such a difference in ex·
terno] things thet one is preferable to another?

3. Herillus limits the virtue of the segete scienoe and knowledge He

considers prsotical lile, which is occupied about external things, as simply
necessary, and denies it to be beautiful, on the grormd that it does not
contribute aught to the supreme good

This principle, common to these three philosophers, strilres at the root
ot practical morality. For if lile is not preferable to death bealth to ἀεὶ·
