here to aid those who are uot familiar with the doctrines of the sonu
philosophy, in understumling the somewhat oboeure sentences in this amm

'llre Stoic believes that nothing cau be a good for man which does not
pertain to himself ; tlmt he is therefore only concerned fo know what hit

nature a, and then to perfect it All men indeed uncousciously make it
their ultimate aim to bring themselves nearer to perfectiora But thswiss
man, becoming consciens of this ultimate aim, leaves the indirect pathsby
which the artificial motives and social prejudices and passinus of men sset
for happiness, and shapes his course directly towards this gual. t

Nothing, at the first glauce, appears more absmd inthe systemdha '
Stolos tinur this: that they, who consider virtue the only gcod, set down sll
the duties of which Cicero treats iu this beolr among things indifferent·- ἶ
things which, like riches and honor, are neither good nor bad-which daem ·
some preference to be sure, but never further the true happiness of man ¹

But this system finds a parallel iu the creed of theologians, who conida
sinful the virtues of the heathen, and account every performanoe of duty, ,
which does not spring from Christian motives, better indeed thau ths neg*
leet of the same, but insufficient to make man acceptable to his Malo or
blessed in himself Now to the Christian of these theologians correspordt
the wise man of the Stoics. The virtues of the heathen and the uncouverbd
are their media ‹fileto-acts by which ertemal good is secured and eri
avoided, but which nevertheless give no sign of true, internal, moral good
ness. The virtues of the Christian, the acts of the completely reformedor
rather, the completely developed-the altogether perfect man—ars tls
officia perfecta.

The substance of this is, that man’s acts hold a twofold relation3 one
to the heart· aud spirit of the man, from which they spring, the otberto
the effects which they cause in the world Perfection—the true good, liet
only in man, in his inner, spiritual nature, in his fancies, his inclinatione
External acts therefore can bc good or bad only in the first of the two rela-
tions mentioned above-they can share in perfectiori only so far as they
arethe outbreaks of the soul's excellence.

In the second relation, that ie, in relation to the outward aims and con
sequences, each act can have only that degree of value or wonhlesmes
which the things themselves have, of which it is the cause. If I alleviata
the pain of a sufferer, or relieve the want of a poor man, the act can bs
estimated no higher than the health which I restore, or the want which l
have satisfied. But inasmuch as these things, according to the system of
the Stoics, are neither good nor evil, that act itself, estimated only in view
of its effecte, can be called neither good nor evil It bas certainly a velue,
because health and sustenance are valuable; but this valueis onlysogreat
that there arises a differenoe between it and its opposite, in accordanoo
with wlueh choice must be made, in case of a choice, but not so great rna
it would be in itself a proper object of desire.
