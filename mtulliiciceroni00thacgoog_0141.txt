nra. 1. car. 111. 133

Man hae his own regularly constituted nature. ΑΗ the faorlties ot hir
beirrg have certain tendencies If this nature exist in its entire complete·
nese and extent, if all these tendencies are fully satisfied, then the manis
virtuoua All that such a man does is good, is sareptepa‚is perfect duty.
It may perhaps, in the eyes of the whole world, not be different from that

which the ordinary, or eren the bad man does; it may perhaps, in relation
to the good of society, be of equal value, but within ithae a spirit altogether
different—a different power. The one man works always with all the
facrrlties of a perfect seul, and these faculties in mutual union and in har-
mony. The other is, so to speak, called out aud determined only by the
occasion. True virtue is an ever-buming tire, which produces of itself light
and beat The virtue of the imperfect man is a light kindled for the oc·
cesion, a warmth imparted for the moment

An aet may be adapted to circumstances and satisfy seme tisible rela-
cone It may benefit many and herm no one. And then the great portion
tf mankind call it upright and ask nothing more. But the sharper eye of the
philosopher searches deeper. It sees a great difference between the man·
ner in which this act is performed by the wisc man, on the oue hand, and
by the common man on the other-by him whose characteris thoroughly
and always upright, and by him who determines to do right this time in
riew only of motives derived from present circumstances. From this comes
the Greek name given hythe Stoice to such a duty, and their definition
which Cicero here introduces. 'I'hey call such a duty raderer, tte netto·
tle, the fluing, and detine it es an act for which rational grounds ean be
given

The reflecting reader will be struck by this, eud ask: Gan there be a
higher goodnese of actions, than that of having performed them according
to reasonl “Certainly uot,’' would the Stoie answer, “if it were the com·
pletely enlightened reason The definitiou does not mean to say that the
drrties commonly requi:ed and performed in human life, are altogether in
accordance with reason but that they can be justified Moreover, in the
case of a perfect aet, which we eall κατόρθωμα, the whole of the conductis
taken into riew; in the case of that which we call καθῆκον, only indiridual
acle, separate from the rest. Each act ettalus exact moral rectitude only
by its union with the whole life. The life of the wisc man is a harmonicus
whole3 the life of the fool consists of fragments There are times when
the latter has become attentive to circumstances, and has found out what
he ought to do, and there are times when he has only followed his undis·
ciplined nature. The wise man ever acts according to character, and thie
is good Dutiea of the inferior sort are performed rather from a considera·
tion of circumstances; duties of the higher kind, from the inner impulsae
of the souP'

Itis now easy to understand, that according to these ideas, the Stolos
'rere obliged to consider all perfect duties equal, and to allow no degrees
